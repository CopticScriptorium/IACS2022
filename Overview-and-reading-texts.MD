## <a name="intro"></a>Overview of Coptic Scriptorium Resources

* reading/browsing texts
* link to the dictionary
* link to online natural language processing tools so that you can use them yourself
* ANNIS database of texts and annotations
* links to all our tools

## Reading/browsing texts

http://data.copticscriptorium.org/ 
* top menu allows you to browse by author, text group
* go there and browse the menu to pick a text or use one of these
  * [Sayings of the Desert Fathers 41 (Syncletica 9)](http://data.copticscriptorium.org/texts/ap/apophthegmata-patrum-sahidic-041-syncletica-9-11/norm)
   * [Shenoute's _Not Because a Fox Barks_](http://data.copticscriptorium.org/texts/not_because_a_fox_barks/not-because-a-fox-barks-xh-204-216/norm)

What do you notice?  Consider:
  * Hover over the text with your cursor. Does anything pop up?
  * Can you click on anything?  What does it do?
  * What else besides “text” is in this digital edition?  What other information can I find?

Some explanations:

  * The "Normalized" button will give you a digital edition of the normalized text. 
  * The "Analytic" button will show you an edition of an aligned normalized text, English translation (when available), and part of speech tagging for each word.
  * The "Diplomatic" button will provide a digital edition of a diplomatic manuscript transcription
  * If you're looking at any of these digital editions, scroll down to see the document's _metadata_ (or information about the document).
  
After you've played around, here's a review of key features:
  * Normalized editions: English translation (if available) pops up on hover; words linked to the online [Coptic Dictionary](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/coptic-dictionary/) ("Chapter view" for biblical books.)
  * Diplomatic editions: manuscript page number pops up on hover
  * Analytic editions are aligned Coptic/English (if available)
  * You can filter different features and information about the text using the menu.
  * All a document's metadata is underneath the edition.
  * You can search for a string of characters on any document page using the usual command-f command on your computer

All the editions you see are visualizations generated from text that has been encoded and annotated according to disciplinary standards. The project releases digitized and annotated text in these formats:
  * Text Encoding Initiative Extensible Markup Language (TEI-XML) files
  * PAULA XML files
  * The online installation of the files in the search and visualization tool (or database) we use (called ANNIS)
  * The raw files used in the ANNIS installation (relANNIS files)

If you want to cite a document or visualization in a publication:
  1. See the Citation information after each document's metadata.  
  2. See our [Citation Guidelines](http://copticscriptorium.org/citation-guidelines.html) page.
  3. **Always make a note of your document URN and relevant metadata, especially the version number and date of the document.** 
  4. You might also want to save visualizations for your own records by saving the webpage or printing to pdf.
  5. **Many researchers create spreadsheets with individual rows for each query or element of research containing the date, version number, other metadata, query (if you are querying the ANNIS database), relevant web link (to the document or to the database query) and filename of visualizations or downloaded results

The following buttons will take you to those data files:

Perseus and Papyri.info also use TEI XML encoding for their digital editions.  Coptic Scriptorium is a multi-disciplinary project; we also release our corpora in PAULA XML files, since the PAULA format is used for linguistic research.
